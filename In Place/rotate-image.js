/**
Rotate Image

Description:
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

/**
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
 * Big O complexity: O(n^2), The code consists of two nested loops, each iterating over the size of the matrix (n). Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).
